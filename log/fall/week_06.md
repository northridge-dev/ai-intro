# Week 6 - 2024-09-30 to 2024-10-04

We'll wrap up our work on the [pancake number problem](https://py.northridge.dev/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnorthridge-dev%2Fpancake-number&urlpath=tree%2Fpancake-number%2F0_pancake.ipynb&branch=main). We want to learn what we can about 
search problems because we'll look at another search problem next: solving mazes!

## Thursday, October 3, 2024

- Choose your adventure:
  - Get back to some good 'ol Python notebooks
  - Turning the pancake problem on its head: backwards search??
