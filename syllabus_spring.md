## Course Description

In the second semester of this year-long course, you will learn to code
(or code better) by creating programs that exhibit **intelligence** in
meaningful ways. We'll use our experience building intelligent systems to
ground philosophical discussions about the nature of intelligence and what
the existence of machine intelligence means for us humans.

## Goals

### Artificial Intelligence

1. Be able to articulate what it means for a machine or system to be
   _intelligent_.
2. Understand and be able to implement a variety of techniques for building
   intelligent systems.

### Python Programming

1. Learn a little about how computers work and how your code _programs_ them.
2. Write some non-trivial code in Python.
3. Practice writing good code: elegant, efficient, robust, etc.
4. Practice reading and assessing code and offering constructive feedback.
5. Build your problem-solving muscles. We'll focus on a few techniques:

   - _decomposing_ big problems into smaller, more tractable ones
   - using _abstraction_ to manage complexity

6. Improve your ability to communicate technical concepts and decisions to both
   technical and non-technical audiences.

Put another way, by the end of the course, you should be able to:

- write an interesting program,
- understand how it works, what is good or inventive or craftsman-like in it,
  and how it can be improved,
- and explain it and your design to both me and your parents / grandparents /
  friends who weren't brave or wise or lucky enough to take this course.

## The Plan

Here's my best guess about how we'll organize ourselves and use our time. We'll
tweak the plan as we go.

### The Work

In class, I will demonstrate concepts and techniques and step through examples
and solutions. You're expected to follow closely and ask questions.

Otherwise, you'll usually be coding, typically working on projects to explore
central concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence.

Homework, when it is assigned, will typically require reading or watching videos
to introduce or expand on material we'll cover in class. Occasionally, you may
need to work on coding projects outside of class.

### Differentiation

Some of you are new to coding, some of you have a little experience, and some of
you have considerable experience. Here's how we'll keep the everyone challenged
without leaving anyone behind.

- Exercises are meant to be self-paced.
- Projects will have a core set of requirements and challenges or extension for
  anyone ready to stretch further or go deeper.

### Topics

Here's a very rough sketch of the topics we'll cover:

1. Informed search techniques
2. Uncertainty and probability
3. Machine learning

   - classic machine learning (regression, decision trees, etc.)
   - neural networks, deep learning

4. Generative AI (LLMs and diffusion models)

I will publish a plan for the week before each week's first class.

## Grades

Your quarter and semester grades will be determined as follows:

- 40% projects, project presentations, in-class assignments, and homework
- 40% quizzes and tests (approximately 4 or 5 per quarter, some cumulative)
- 20% capstone project

Quarter and semester grades will be assigned according to the Northridge
grading scale.

## Materials

Please bring to class every day:

1. Something to write with (pen or pencil, as you prefer)
2. A notebook or binder with paper for notes
3. A folder or binder to keep and organize handouts and other materials

## Tools

- [Northridge Dev](https://northridge.dev)

  - daily logs, schedules, notes, resources, exercises and assignments
  - some features require logging in with your Northridge credentials

Web-based tools for which you'll need an account. Some require phone verification.

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

## Responsible Use of Technology

Follow the Computer and Network Technology policy in the student handbook.

If you feel like you need to hide your screen, switch tabs or windows, or
clear your browser history, you're falling short of the mark.

## A Note on Generative AI and Other Code You Didn't Write

We wouldn’t be able to build very interesting projects if we had to write every
line of code ourselves. Indeed, almost all software development depends on code
that developers share with each other, often for free.

It’s fairly easy to find or generate code that can satisfy all or part of your
assignments. We’ll spend time learning how to learn from and responsibly use
such tools. So don't be afraid to tell us where you got an idea, trick, or technique.
I'm most interested in your ability to thoroughly explain your code. If you can't
explain it, it isn't really yours, at least not in the ways that matter most.
