# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Tutorials

Before trying to build our own KnotebookLM RAG service, we'll get some practice
by following one or two tutorials. Doing so will also help us get familiar with
the tools (libraries) we might choose to build with.

## Popular RAG Tools

We'll explore one or both of these popular libraries for RAG:

- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)

There are others. If you find something interesting, let me know.

## RAG Overviews

Start by reading one or both of these high-level overviews. Each doubles as an
introduction to the abstractions the library provides.

- [LangChain's RAG Overview](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/rag/)
- [LlamaIndex's RAG Overview](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/rag/)

## Google API

We'll use Google's generative AI APIs because they offer a pretty generous free
tier. Ideally, you'll each generate your own API key. I'll walk you through the
process in class. If we run into problems, you can use my API key.

## Tutorials

### LangChain

- [Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App: Part 1](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/)
- (If you get through Part 1)
  [Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App: Part 2](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/)
  If you want some more guided help outside of class, you can register for a
  DeepLearning.AI account and enroll in the
  [LangChain: Chat with Your Data](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/)
  short course.

### LlamaIndex

- [Starter Tutorial](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/starter_example/)
- [Discover LlamaIndex video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0jcvGiBKSA&list=PLTZkGHtR085ZjK1srrSZIrkeEzQiMjO9W)

## Google CoLab or GitHub Codespace

It's probably a little easier to use Google CoLab for these tutorials since it
allows you to see outputs at each step, but you can also use GitHub Codespaces
if you prefer.
